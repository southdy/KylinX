 *
 *    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/149932/naming-conventions-for-threads
 *
 *   If a system imposes requirements, SDL will try to munge the string for
 *    it (truncate, etc), but the original string contents will be available
 *    from SDL_GetThreadName().
 *
 *   The size (in bytes) of the new stack can be specified. Zero means "use
 *    the system default" which might be wildly different between platforms
 *    (x86 Linux generally defaults to eight megabytes, an embedded device
 *    might be a few kilobytes instead).
 *
 *   In SDL 2.1, stacksize will be folded into the original SDL_CreateThread
